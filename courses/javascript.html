                <p><strong><u>JavaScript</u> :-</strong>
                JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

                <p><strong><u>Difference between Java and JavaScript.</u> :-</strong>
                    Both Java and JavaScript are written, assembled and executed differently, and each has dramatic differences when it comes to what it is capable of doing.
                <br><br>
                Java is used in a wide range of places, including Android apps, credit card programming and in the creation of desktop applications and web enterprise applications. By comparison, JavaScript is mainly used to make web pages more interactive. It can be used as an alternative to Flash, though most programmers will tell you that JavaScript is more popular and has more functionality than Flash. JavaScript can be used to do neat things like creating animation in HTML.
                <br><br>
                In a nutshell, when it comes to how each language is used, Java is typically used for all server side development, while JavaScript is reserved for developing client side scripts for functions like validation and interactivity. There are some other key differences:

                    <li>Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.</li>
                    <li>Each language requires different plug-ins.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.</li>
                    <li>Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.</li>
